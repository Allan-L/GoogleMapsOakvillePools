*IMPORTANT NOTE - Hello, so I was developing this with the live server extension on vscode and it ran fine, but for whatever reason when i try to run this by clicking index.html there is an issue with
geocoding. I did a google search and apparantly the API KEY that was provided needs the DIRECTIONS API to be enabled in the settings.

-APP OVERVIEW-

This app uses JSON data of Oakville recreation facilities, the UI allows the user to filter by different water facilities, and will get the users location on load.
Once the user clicks their desired water facility they can see the route shown and the time it will take to get to the destination. 
The user can also change the method of travel, and the map will update accordingly.
